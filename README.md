# CONSUMERS-PREFERENCE-ANALYSIS-FOR-FASHION-ADDICTS-UK-2019
In a bid to understand their customers'choices, Fashion Addicts UK collected their clients data in 2019, analysed and arrived at the conclusion through the analysis that their best selling product/line was clothing.


Through the analysis of the data provided by Fashion Addicts, a UK clothing brand, who seeks to understand her customer's preferences and choices so as to know how to serve them better,  it has been deduced that the brand serves 45% medium sized clients and about 28% Large szied clients leaving the other 30% between the Small and Extra larged sizes. These Fashion addicts also prefer the Free shipping method to every other method provided by the brand and also havr relatvely all age groups shopping from them directly with the middle age (48 - 57) topping the chart. 

However, to be able to manage these clients in order to guaurantee customer satisfaction and indirectly have them coming back for more thereby increasing the revenue of the company, the following would be recommended

The management of this establishment should consider fashion items that are most preferred by the middle aged group and stock these products in mostly Medium sizes while also breaking into the styles and trends for younger age grouos as these age groups would guaurantee more sustainability forthe company in general
Also, A shopping addict tends to shop more when he/she realises that the products are going to be delivered free to the convenience of his/her home and as such, the issue of free shipping can be looked into to avoid the company acquiring losses while trying to satisfy thier customers by indirectly applying the cost of shipping on these items before publishing the prices of items in stock making the customers shop more thereby increaing sales and revenue. 
Another way to tackle this issue of free shipping would be to declare a minimum order quantity that allows a customer shop a certain number or price value of items to be able to access the free shipping option. This promotes bulk buying and indirectly, increases revenue.
Finally, seeing that their major customers are middle aged men and women would indirectly discourage the youth who are the real fashion addicts/crazy people from shoping fromtheirwebsite thereby losing these age groups to their competitors. it would be paramount to eith engage the services of a marketing expert and brand consultant to see that the management of this group priotizes stocking items thatare more appealing to the younger groups and device means to get them involved and always be in their faces as thye are moire likely to splurge their money onnfshion items and products.
